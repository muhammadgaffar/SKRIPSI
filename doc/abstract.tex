\noindent Strongly correlated system is physical system where the interaction among particle cannot be neglected. Dynamical Mean Field Theory(DMFT) becomes one of the established method to explain and calculate physical observable of strongly correlated system. Here we study the impurity solver in DMFT for Hubbard model, the simplest model for strongly correlated system. We realizing that exact impurity solver gives high numerical cost, where approximate impurity solver gives relative low numerical cost. Here we develop another low numerical cost to aim more exact result than approximate method, where we developed it from mean-field method where is the occupation fluctuation is taking into account in the semi-classical sense. We compare this method by another lower numerical impurity solver, i.e mean-field and iterated perturbation theory, where they are studied in restricted case of paramagnetic and unrestricted case of magnetic ordering. We concluded that occupation fluctuation not really giving exact result if we compared to mean-field and iterated perturbation theory, but becomes interesting if we implement occupation fluctuation as iterated perturbation theory correction.\\
